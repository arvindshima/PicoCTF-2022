## Description

Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this?
Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

#### Hint

- Audacity is a really good program to analyze morse code audio.

## Approach

Instead of Audacity, I used to upload the provided morse-code audio file to the [Morse Audio Decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-expert.html).
